## 🚨 REMAINING MINOR ISSUES (NON-BLOCKING)

### ⚠️ MINOR DEPENDENCY ISSUES

   - Priority: Medium (can be fixed post-deployment)

2. **File Parsers Test File** (Non-Critical)
   - Issue: Missing test PDF file during import
   - Impact: Does not affect functionality, only test data
   - Resolution: Remove test file dependency from imports
   - Priority: Low (cosmetic issue)

3. **Route Events Cache** (Non-Critical)
   - Issue: Events module cache issue
   - Impact: May affect route loading in some environments
   - Resolution: Clear module cache or restart process
   - Priority: Low (environment-specific)
